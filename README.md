Analysis of German Credit Data

This is use case where we employ classification algorith to solve an important banking problem.

When a bank receives a loan application, based on the applicant’s profile the bank has to make a decision regarding whether to go ahead with the loan approval or not. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision –

If the applicant is a good credit risk, i.e. is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan to the person results in a loss of business to the bank
If the applicant is a bad credit risk, i.e. is not likely to repay the loan, then approving the loan to the person results in a financial loss to the bank

Objective of Analysis:

<b>Minimization of risk and maximization of profit on behalf of the bank.</b>

To minimize loss from the bank’s perspective, the bank needs a decision rule regarding who to give approval of the loan and who not to. An applicant’s demographic and socio-economic profiles are considered by loan managers before a decision is taken regarding his/her loan application.

The German Credit Data contains data on 20 variables and the classification whether an applicant is considered a Good or a Bad credit risk for 1000 loan applicants. 
A predictive model developed on this data is expected to provide a bank manager guidance for making a decision whether to approve a loan to a prospective applicant based on his/her profiles.
